<!--

PLEASE NOTE: the react-plotly.js library is a thin, stable wrapper around the large, active https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js library.

Most questions and issues encountered while using react-plotly.js are actually related to plotly.js and it's often best to submit issues in that repo instead of this one: https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/new

Of course, certain issues pertain specifically to the React wrapper and are appropriate for this repo :)

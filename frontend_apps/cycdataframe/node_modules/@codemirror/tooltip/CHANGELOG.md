## 0.19.4 (2021-10-13)

## 0.19.3 (2021-10-11)

### Bug fixes

Fix an issue where a newly created (or reconfigured) editor wouldn't show its tooltips until the first change or scroll event.

### New features

Tooltips now accept an `arrow` option to show a little triangle between the tooltip and its target position.

## 0.19.2 (2021-09-01)

### Bug fixes

Fix accidental assignment to const.

## 0.19.1 (2021-08-30)

### New features

The new `tooltips` function can be used to configure tooltip behavior. For now, the only option is `position`, which allows you to choose between fixed and absolute positioning.

## 0.19.0 (2021-08-11)

### Bug fixes

Move tooltips to avoid overlapping between them, when necessary.

Make sure tooltips don't stay visible when the editor goes out of view.

### New features

Hover tooltips are now grouped together in a single DOM element when multiple such tooltips are active.

## 0.18.4 (2021-03-15)

### Breaking changes

It is no longer necessary to use the `tooltips` extension when using this packageâ€”just providing values through `showTooltip` will implicitly enable the necessary extensions.

Tooltips no longer use the `class` property on the spec object (just apply the class yourself when creating the DOM element).

### Bug fixes

Tooltips in a dark theme that doesn't explicitly style them no longer use the light theme defaults.

### New features

`showTooltip` now accepts null as input value, which doesn't produce a tooltip.

## 0.18.3 (2021-03-14)

### Bug fixes

Fix a crash in tooltip creation.

## 0.18.2 (2021-03-14)

### Bug fixes

Fix an issue where tooltips created in an out-of-view editor show up in the wrong place.

## 0.18.1 (2021-03-04)

### New features

The source callback to `hoverTooltip` may now return a promise.

## 0.18.0 (2021-03-03)

### Breaking changes

Extra CSS classes for tooltips must now be specified with the `class` option. The `style` option no longer exists.

## 0.17.2 (2021-01-14)

### Bug fixes

Fix tooltip positioning on iOS, which still handles position: fixed strangely.

## 0.17.1 (2021-01-06)

The package now also exports a CommonJS module.

## 0.17.0 (2020-12-29)

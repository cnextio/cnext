# v0.4.10

##### NEW

-   This is where you layout any new features.
-   Explain where these features are within your app.
-   How do users find these new features?
-   Which users will this benefits, or how exactly will this benefits them?
-   E.g. "[Who benefits?] Apple Watch users will be particularly happy with the latest release. [Why?] We now automatically support handoff with your Mac. [Where/how?] Don’t forget to have your bluetooth turned on, you can do it]!"

##### IMPROVED

-   If improving an existing feature, rather than something that’s brand new, use the "Improvements" title instead of "New".
-   If you've improved something as a result of user feedback, consider a sentence like, "you asked, we listened". A great way to make your users feel valued.

##### FIXED

-   List out any major bugs that might have affected many users.
-   If you've only addressed minor fixes, or nothing specific, use something like:
-   E.g. "Minor Bug fixes"
-   Keep the "Fixed" title if you've included other titled sections.

## üîÆ Overview

CNext is a workspace for DS and AI workflows. This workspace is meant to consolidate the most common tasks performed by data scientists and ML engineers. At a high level our workspace allows for:

-   Data exploration & transformation
-   Model development / exploration
-   Production code generation
-   Dashboard & App Generation
-   Experiment Management

## üì¢ Features

-   Interactive Python coding envrionment with native Python output (think Jupyter replacement)
-   Smart code suggestion (categorical values and column names)
-   Interactive data exploration
-   Automative visualizations
-   Experiment and model management
-   Instant dashboarding

üöÄ **Requests:** We're actively developing features based off user feedback, if you'd like to make any suggestions please feel free to hit us up on Slack. 

## üìÑ Installation via Pip

PLEASE NOTE: CNext requires npm >= 18.4 and Python >= 3.9.7 . Please ensure your environment meets the minimum requirements before beginning the installation. 

Step 1: Make sure `Nodejs` is available in your computer (try `npm --version`)

Step 2: `run` command `pip install -U cnext`

Step 3: `run` command `cnext`

-   Input `Enter path to the cnext sample project created in Step 1` and hit `Enter` (Example `C:/Skywalker`)

-   Web application will launch at : `http://localhost:CLIENT_PORT` or `http://127.0.0.1:CLIENT_PORT/` (CLIENT_PORT default is 4000)
-   Stop application: `Ctrl + c | Command + c`
-   Note: Pay attention at `CLIENT_PORT`, and `SERVER_PORT` in `.env` file (you will have to change these ports if you already use them on your machine)

## üìÑ Installation via Docker

cnext is also available via pre-built Docker images. To get started, you can simply run the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -p 5000:5000 -p 5011:5011 -p 5008:5008 -p 5005:5005 cycai/cnext
```

The web application will launch at: `http://localhost:4000` or `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`
